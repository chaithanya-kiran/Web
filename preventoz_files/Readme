Worked on implementing the User Interface as shown in ui_casestudy.png

For UI I used Bootstrap framework along with HTML5 and CSS and I used Jquery AJAX for loading more results dynamically from MySQL database with PHP.For mocking server calls/api-request/api-response I used static json.

Attached demo,screenshots and files of the case study.
